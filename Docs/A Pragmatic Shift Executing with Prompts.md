# A Pragmatic Shift – Executing with Prompts

## **Context**

The OpenAPIHandlerGen project began as a tool to generate Swift handlers and services based on OpenAPI specifications. While the core functionality, such as YAML parsing, endpoint extraction, and code generation, was implemented, the testing framework remained incomplete, leaving significant gaps in reliability and validation.

### **Initial Observations**
Through detailed analysis and examination of the codebase, the following issues were identified:
1. **Empty Test Framework:**
   - The single test file (`File.swift`) was a placeholder, containing no functional test cases.
2. **No CI/CD Integration:**
   - Lack of automated pipelines for testing and validation.
3. **Unvalidated Features:**
   - Core functions (YAML parsing, endpoint mapping, code generation) were untested, risking undetected errors in production.
4. **Error Handling Gaps:**
   - Error scenarios lacked structured testing, logging, and debugging.

## **Shift to a Pragmatic Approach**

### **Key Realization**
It became clear that achieving testing goals required **pragmatism**—leveraging real-time iterative development instead of traditional long-term planning. With directed dialogue using ChatGPT, we could execute tasks incrementally within this interactive environment.

### **Proposed Strategy**
A step-by-step **directed dialogue workflow** was defined to:
1. Establish the **XCTest framework** and implement **baseline tests**.
2. Build **incremental unit tests** focused on YAML parsing and endpoint extraction.
3. Implement **CI/CD pipelines** for automated testing.
4. Enhance **error handling tests** and **logging validation**.
5. Deliver **documentation and reports** dynamically during execution.

## **Execution Roadmap**
The roadmap was structured into **phases**, with each phase focusing on achieving actionable deliverables:

### **Phase 1: Testing Framework Setup**
- Integrate XCTest.
- Write initial tests for YAML parsing.

### **Phase 2: Feature Tests**
- Test YAML parsing (valid/invalid inputs).
- Validate endpoint extraction logic.

### **Phase 3: CI/CD Integration**
- Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing.
- Verify workflows.

### **Phase 4: Error Handling and Logging**
- Test structured error handling and logging outputs.

### **Phase 5: Documentation and Reporting**
- Summarize test coverage gaps.
- Generate reports dynamically.

## **Prompt Sequence for Execution**
To guide the execution process pragmatically, we defined a **prompt sequence** that supports incremental implementation. Prompts are defined as **pieces of instructional text** provided to ChatGPT during the directed dialogue to produce specific outputs.

### **Prompts**

#### **Prompt 1 - Setup XCTest Framework**
> Integrate XCTest into the project and create an initial test structure, including a template test case for YAML parsing validation.

#### **Prompt 2 - Unit Tests for YAML Parsing**
> Write tests for valid YAML parsing, including edge cases for invalid inputs, empty YAML, and nested structures.

#### **Prompt 3 - Endpoint Extraction Tests**
> Write tests for endpoint extraction, ensuring validation of valid paths, methods, IDs, mismatched mappings, duplicates, and incomplete definitions.

#### **Prompt 4 - CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
> Generate GitHub Actions YAML configuration for automated test execution and validate workflows.

#### **Prompt 5 - Error Handling and Logging**
> Write tests to verify error propagation, logs for invalid inputs, mismatches, and structured debug messages.

#### **Prompt 6 - Documentation and Reports**
> Summarize test coverage gaps, generate test roadmaps, and finalize documentation for GitHub issues.

## **Current Status**
The pragmatic approach has already:
- Defined a structured plan to build tests incrementally.
- Delegated tasks across issues to avoid redundancy.
- Prioritized immediate deliverables for quick wins.
- Ensured traceability by linking subtasks to parent issues.

## **Commit Reference**
This document is committed in reference to **Issue #13: Identify Areas with Insufficient Coverage**, as it outlines the framework to address testing gaps and establish a solid foundation for validation.

## **Conclusion**
This pragmatic approach prioritizes incremental execution and dynamic validation, ensuring rapid development cycles without sacrificing quality. As tasks are executed through directed dialogue, this document will serve as a **guiding reference** for building a scalable and reliable test framework.

## Introduction

When working with Swift projects managed by Swift Package Manager (SwiftPM), setting up continuous integration (CI) workflows is essential for ensuring code quality and reliability. While GitHub Actions provides a robust CI/CD platform, there are scenarios where running these workflows locally can enhance development efficiency. This guide explores how to use [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act), a tool that emulates GitHub Actions locally, enabling you to develop, test, and debug your CI/CD pipelines without pushing changes to your repository.

---

## What is `act`?

[`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act) is an open-source tool that allows you to run your GitHub Actions workflows locally using Docker. It emulates the GitHub Actions runner environment, enabling you to:

- **Test workflows** before pushing them to GitHub.
- **Debug actions** interactively.
- **Speed up development** by iterating locally without committing.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

1. **Git:** Version control system.
2. **Docker:** Required by `act` to emulate the GitHub Actions environment.
3. **`act`:** The tool itself.
4. **Swift and Swift Package Manager (SwiftPM):** For managing your Swift projects.

---

## Installing `act`

### Using Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

If you're on macOS or Linux, you can install `act` using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install act
```

### Using Binary Releases

Alternatively, you can download pre-built binaries from the [act Releases](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases) page:

1. Go to the [act Releases](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases) page.
2. Download the appropriate binary for your operating system.
3. Make the binary executable and move it to a directory in your `PATH`:

    ```bash
    chmod +x act_<version>_<os>_<arch>
    sudo mv act_<version>_<os>_<arch> /usr/local/bin/act
    ```

### Verifying Installation

After installation, verify that `act` is installed correctly:

```bash
act --version
```

You should see output similar to:

```
0.2.25
```

## Setting Up GitHub Actions for SwiftPM

To use `act`, you need to have GitHub Actions workflows defined in your repository. Here's how to set up a basic workflow for a SwiftPM project.

### 1. Create a GitHub Actions Workflow

In your Swift project repository, create a directory for workflows if it doesn't exist:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

### 2. Define a Workflow YAML File

Create a workflow file, e.g., `swift.yml`:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/swift.yml
name: Swift CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Swift
        uses: actions/setup-swift@v3
        with:
          swift-version: '5.7' # Specify your Swift version

      - name: Build
        run: swift build -v

      - name: Run Tests
        run: swift test -v
```

**Explanation:**

- **`on`**: Triggers the workflow on pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch.
- **`jobs.build`**: Defines a job named `build`.
- **`runs-on`**: Specifies the runner environment (`ubuntu-latest`).
- **`steps`**: Defines the sequence of steps to execute:
  - **Checkout** the repository.
  - **Set up Swift** environment.
  - **Build** the project.
  - **Run Tests**.

### 3. Commit and Push

Commit your workflow file and push it to GitHub:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/swift.yml
git commit -m "Add Swift CI workflow"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Actions will automatically run this workflow on the specified triggers.

---

## Running Workflows Locally with `act`

Now, let's run the above workflow locally using `act`.

### 1. Initialize `act` in Your Repository

Navigate to your project's root directory (where `.github/workflows` is located).

### 2. List Available Workflows

To see the available workflows, run:

```bash
act -l
```

**Example Output:**

```
Available workflows:
  1. name: Swift CI
     event: push
     jobs: build
```

### 3. Run a Specific Workflow

To run the `Swift CI` workflow, execute:

```bash
act push
```

**Explanation:**

- **`push`**: Simulates a `push` event, triggering workflows that respond to `push` events.

### 4. Specify a Workflow File (Optional)

If you have multiple workflows or want to run a specific one, you can specify the workflow file:

```bash
act -e push --job build
```

**Note:** The `-e` flag can be used to specify a custom event payload, but for most standard events like `push`, you don't need to provide an event file.

### 5. Use a Specific Runner

By default, `act` uses `ubuntu-latest`. To specify a different runner, use the `-P` flag:

```bash
act push -P ubuntu-latest=nektos/act-environments-ubuntu:18.04
```

**Note:** Ensure that the Docker image corresponds to the runner specified in your workflow (`ubuntu-latest` in this case).

### 6. Interactive Mode

For an interactive experience, especially useful for debugging, use:

```bash
act -i
```

This allows you to inspect logs and outputs in real-time.

## Example: SwiftPM Project with `act`

Let's walk through a complete example of setting up `act` with a SwiftPM project.

### 1. Initialize a SwiftPM Project

If you don't already have a SwiftPM project, create one:

```bash
swift package init --type executable
```

### 2. Create the GitHub Actions Workflow

As described earlier, create `.github/workflows/swift.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Swift CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Swift
        uses: actions/setup-swift@v3
        with:
          swift-version: '5.7'

      - name: Build
        run: swift build -v

      - name: Run Tests
        run: swift test -v
```

### 3. Install `act` and Docker

Ensure Docker is running on your machine. Install `act` as per the [Installing `act`](#installing-act) section.

### 4. Run the Workflow Locally

Execute the workflow:

```bash
act push
```

**Expected Output:**

`act` will:

1. Pull the necessary Docker images (if not already present).
2. Checkout your repository.
3. Set up the specified Swift version.
4. Build your project using `swift build`.
5. Run tests using `swift test`.

**Sample Output:**

```
[Build] üöÄ  Start image=node:12.18.3
[Build]   üê≥  docker pull nektos/act-environments-ubuntu:18.04
[Build]   üê≥  docker pull ghcr.io/actions/checkout:3
[Build]   üê≥  docker pull ghcr.io/actions/setup-swift:3
[Build]   üê≥  docker pull nektos/act-environments-ubuntu:18.04
[Build]   üê≥  docker pull ghcr.io/actions/setup-swift:3
[Build]   üê≥  docker pull ghcr.io/actions/checkout:3
[Build]   üê≥  docker pull ghcr.io/actions/setup-swift:3
[Build]   üê≥  docker pull ghcr.io/actions/checkout:3
[Build]   üê≥  docker pull ghcr.io/actions/setup-swift:3
[Build]   üê≥  docker pull ghcr.io/actions/setup-swift:3
[Build] ‚≠ê  Run actions/checkout@v3

[Build]   ...
[Build] ‚≠ê  Run swift build -v
[Build]   ...
[Build] ‚≠ê  Run swift test -v
[Build]   ...
[Build] ‚úÖ  Complete job
```

**Note:** The actual output will include detailed logs of each step.

## Advanced Configuration

### 1. Customizing the Event Payload

By default, `act` uses a standard event payload. To customize it, create a JSON file representing the event and use the `-e` flag:

```json
// .act/event.json
{
  "ref": "refs/heads/main",
  "head_commit": {
    "message": "Add new feature",
    "author": {
      "name": "Your Name",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

Run `act` with the custom event:

```bash
act push -e .act/event.json
```

### 2. Passing Secrets and Environment Variables

If your workflows use secrets, you can pass them to `act` using environment variables or a secrets file.

#### Using Environment Variables

Set secrets as environment variables with the `ACTIONS_SECRET_` prefix:

```bash
export ACTIONS_SECRET_MY_SECRET="supersecretvalue"
act push
```

#### Using a Secrets File

Create a `.secrets` file:

```bash
# .secrets
MY_SECRET=supersecretvalue
```

Run `act` with the secrets file:

```bash
act push --secret-file .secrets
```

### 3. Specifying a Docker Image for Runners

If you need a specific runner environment, specify it with the `-P` flag:

```bash
act push -P ubuntu-latest=nektos/act-environments-ubuntu:18.04
```

**Note:** Ensure the Docker image matches the runner environment required by your workflows.

### 4. Running Specific Jobs

If your workflow has multiple jobs, you can run a specific job:

```bash
act push --job build
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Docker Not Running

Ensure Docker is installed and running. `act` relies on Docker to emulate GitHub Actions runners.

**Solution:**

- Start Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) or ensure the Docker daemon is running (Linux):

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start docker
    ```

### 2. Permission Issues

Sometimes, Docker may require elevated permissions.

**Solution:**

- Run `act` with `sudo` (not recommended for regular use):

    ```bash
    sudo act push
    ```

- **Better Solution:** Add your user to the `docker` group:

    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    newgrp docker
    ```

### 3. Missing Docker Images

If `act` cannot find the required Docker images, it will attempt to pull them. Ensure you have a stable internet connection.

**Solution:**

- Manually pull the necessary images:

    ```bash
    docker pull nektos/act-environments-ubuntu:18.04
    docker pull ghcr.io/actions/checkout:3
    docker pull ghcr.io/actions/setup-swift:3
    ```

### 4. Workflow Errors

If your workflow fails when running with `act` but works on GitHub, check the following:

- **Differences in Environment:** Ensure the Docker image matches the GitHub runner.
- **Secrets and Environment Variables:** Ensure all required secrets are provided.
- **Network Access:** Some actions may require network access that might be restricted in Docker.

**Solution:**

- Compare the environment setups.
- Provide necessary secrets.
- Adjust Docker settings if needed.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Workflows Modular:**
   - Break down complex workflows into smaller, manageable jobs.

2. **Use Caching:**
   - Utilize caching actions to speed up builds (note that caching with `act` might require additional configuration).

3. **Leverage `act` for Development:**
   - Regularly test and debug workflows locally with `act` before pushing to GitHub.

4. **Maintain Parity Between Local and CI Environments:**
   - Ensure the Docker images and environment configurations used by `act` match those used by GitHub Actions to prevent discrepancies.

5. **Version Control Your Workflows:**
   - Keep your workflow YAML files under version control to track changes and collaborate effectively.

6. **Document Secrets and Environment Variables:**
   - Clearly document required secrets and environment variables to streamline local testing.

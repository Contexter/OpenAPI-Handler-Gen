# Development and Testing Plan for OpenAPIHandlerGen

## 1. Overview
This document outlines a detailed development and testing plan for extending the **OpenAPIHandlerGen** tool. The plan builds incrementally from the current status—validating handler and service generation—to adding support for model and migration generation, ensuring comprehensive testing at each milestone.

---

## 2. Current Status
- **Implemented Features:**
  - Handler and service generation from OpenAPI specifications.
  - Basic parsing of YAML files and endpoint extraction.
- **Pending Features:**
  - Model generation for SQLite schemas.
  - Migration generation for database schema creation.
  - End-to-end testing integration with models and migrations.

---

## 3. Development and Testing Milestones

### **Phase 1: Validate Current Functionality (Handlers and Services)**
**Goal:** Ensure existing handler and service generation works reliably.
- **Development Tasks:**
  1. Finalize the current test suite for parsing and generating handlers/services.
  2. Add tests to validate generated code structure and syntax.
  3. Test outputs against expected templates.
- **Testing Tasks:**
  1. Run tests for valid and invalid inputs.
  2. Verify output consistency and fix issues.
  3. Implement CI/CD integration to automate tests.
- **Milestone Completion Criteria:**
  - All handler/service tests pass with expected outputs.
  - CI/CD integration is functional.

### **Phase 2: Extend to Model Generation**
**Goal:** Add support for generating SQLite models based on OpenAPI schemas.
- **Development Tasks:**
  1. Parse OpenAPI `components.schemas` to extract properties and types.
  2. Map OpenAPI types to Swift/Fluent field types.
  3. Generate Swift model classes aligned with Fluent conventions.
- **Testing Tasks:**
  1. Add tests to validate generated models against expected templates.
  2. Test model field mappings and optional/required field handling.
  3. Verify Swift compilation of generated models.
- **Milestone Completion Criteria:**
  - Models are generated correctly for uploaded examples.
  - Tests confirm schema compliance and compilation success.

---

### **Phase 3: Add Migration Generation**
**Goal:** Generate SQLite migration files for schema creation.
- **Development Tasks:**
  1. Implement migration code generation for each model.
  2. Support required/optional fields and relationships.
  3. Handle schema changes through versioned migrations.
- **Testing Tasks:**
  1. Add tests for generated migration files.
  2. Validate migrations against SQLite databases.
  3. Test rollback scenarios to ensure reversibility.
- **Milestone Completion Criteria:**
  - Migrations compile and apply correctly to SQLite databases.
  - Tests validate schema creation and updates.

---

### **Phase 4: Unified Testing and Optimization**
**Goal:** Integrate all features into a unified pipeline and optimize performance.
- **Development Tasks:**
  1. Optimize code generation for efficiency and readability.
  2. Ensure consistency in naming conventions across handlers, models, and migrations.
  3. Add logging and error handling for debugging and usability.
- **Testing Tasks:**
  1. Combine tests for handlers, services, models, and migrations.
  2. Perform regression testing to catch breaking changes.
  3. Validate outputs for large and complex schemas.
- **Milestone Completion Criteria:**
  - Unified tests pass for all components.
  - CI/CD pipelines enforce consistent validation.

---

### **Phase 5: Documentation and Deployment**
**Goal:** Finalize documentation and prepare the tool for broader usage.
- **Development Tasks:**
  1. Write user guides and API documentation.
  2. Create examples for integrating the tool into workflows.
  3. Package the tool for distribution.
- **Testing Tasks:**
  1. Conduct user acceptance testing with real-world schemas.
  2. Collect feedback and refine features based on testing.
  3. Finalize CI/CD pipelines for releases.
- **Milestone Completion Criteria:**
  - Documentation is complete and reviewed.
  - The tool is deployable and ready for public use.

## 4. Timeline
| Phase                      | Duration   | Target Completion |
|----------------------------|------------|---------------------|
| Phase 1: Validate Current  | 1 week     | TBD                |
| Phase 2: Model Generation  | 2 weeks    | TBD                |
| Phase 3: Migration Gen     | 2 weeks    | TBD                |
| Phase 4: Unified Testing   | 1 week     | TBD                |
| Phase 5: Documentation     | 1 week     | TBD                |

---

## 5. Next Steps
1. Execute **Phase 1** tests immediately for the current handler and service generation.
2. Address any issues identified during testing.
3. Begin **Phase 2** development for model generation once Phase 1 validation is complete.
4. Track progress against milestones and update this plan as needed.

---

## 6. Conclusion
This plan outlines a structured approach to extend and test the **OpenAPIHandlerGen** tool. By focusing first on validating existing functionality, then incrementally adding features with robust testing, the tool will evolve into a comprehensive OpenAPI code generation solution aligned with SQLite and Fluent standards.
